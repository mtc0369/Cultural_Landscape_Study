                "description": "The area of land now known as Point Arguello was originally known by the 'Chumashan—Canalino Indian' name Nocto and was part of the territory ruled by Chief Salipuata at the time of the occupation by the Spanish missionaries. The Native Americans were part of the third indigenous people in the area, the Canalino branch of the Chumash people. In Paleo-indian times, a people of Mongolian heritage first settled along the Southern California coast in areas where oak trees were plentiful, from which characteristic they have been named The Oak Tree (Grove) People. They vanished some hundreds of years B.C.E., and after a period without archaeological evidence, a second semi—nomadic group arrived. These hunting people gradually merged with a third group, the Chumash people, as they settled here.",

The mission was best known for its hides and blankets, and at its peak, 2,000 inhabitants herded as many as 24,000 cattle and sheep.\n\nLa Purisima Mission State Historic Park is open nearly everyday for self-guided tours. The park interpreters lead a free one o-clock tour most days. The park frequently provides a re-creation of mission life during the 1820s, when residents engaged in weaving, pottery making, candle making, blacksmithing, animal husbandry, and leatherwork.",
